# buy.nsw prototypes

These are sketches-in-code of potential future user journeys on buy.nsw.

It's based on the [prototyping kit](https://github.com/digitalnsw/prototyping-kit), which is a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) application, using the [Sinatra web framework](https://http://sinatrarb.com).

## Prerequisites

You will need to install:

- Ruby 2.5.0 – the easiest way to install is with [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build)
- Bundler – run `gem install bundler`

Then run `bundle install` to install all the dependencies.

## Quick start

Run the following in your console window to start the prototyping kit and open the server in your web browser.

```
bin/shotgun -p 5000
open http://localhost:5000
```

More information about what you can do with the kit can be found in [the prototyping kit repository](https://github.com/digitalnsw/prototyping-kit).
